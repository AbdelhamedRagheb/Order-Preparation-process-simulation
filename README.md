# Order Preparation process simulation
 This project simulates the workflow of an order processing system, such as a restaurant, warehouse, or e-commerce fulfillment center. It models how an order progresses through multiple stages—Received, Preparing, Packaging, and Delivery—with each stage taking a predefined amount of time. The simulation helps visualize queue dynamics, bottlenecks, and total order processing time.
